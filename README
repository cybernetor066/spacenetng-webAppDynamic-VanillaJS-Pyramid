Hello everyone and goodday. This is my first fullstack development course completion with a website project and so
i decide to host the codes on this platform GitHub and please do not forget to share with me any possible improvements
you may have found on the codes published here.
The website can be visited here www.spacenetng.com  It is an online marketplace where buyers and sellers meetup and share 
goods and services and make payments.
It's FrontEnd is built with HTML5, CSS3 and VanillaJS, while the BackEnd is built on the pylon's Pyramid web framework based
on the python programming language.
Thanks for your time.
